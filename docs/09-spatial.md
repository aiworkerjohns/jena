# Spatial Filtering

SHACL-mode text search supports spatial filtering via WKT literals indexed as Lucene `LatLonShape` fields. Entities with `geo:asWKT` properties can be filtered by geographic region using CQL2-JSON spatial operators.

## Configuration

Add a `LatLonField` to your shape definition, pointing at the `geo:asWKT` predicate:

```turtle
PREFIX idx:   <urn:jena:lucene:index#>
PREFIX field: <urn:jena:lucene:field#>
PREFIX sh:    <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>
PREFIX geo:   <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>

field:location
    idx:fieldName "location" ;
    idx:fieldType idx:LatLonField .

:SiteShape
    sh:targetClass ex:Site ;
    sh:property [ idx:field field:location ; sh:path geo:asWKT ] ;
    # ... other fields ...
```

`LatLonField` does not support `idx:facetable` or `idx:sortable` (spatial fields are neither sortable nor facetable).

## Supported geometry types

- **Point** — `POINT(x y)`
- **Polygon** — `POLYGON((x1 y1, x2 y2, ...))` (with optional holes)
- **MultiPolygon** — `MULTIPOLYGON(((...)), ((...)), ...)` indexed as multiple polygons on the same Lucene field

Other geometry types (MultiPoint, LineString, etc.) are logged as warnings and skipped during indexing.

## CRS handling

Lucene indexes all coordinates in WGS84 (latitude/longitude in degrees). The indexer automatically handles CRS detection and normalisation:

| Input CRS | Axis order in WKT | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Bare WKT (no prefix) | lon, lat (CRS84 default) | Automatic axis normalisation |
| `<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>` | lat, lon | Used directly |
| `<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>` (GDA94) | lat, lon | Used directly |
| `<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>` (GDA2020) | lat, lon | Used directly |
| Other CRS (e.g. EPSG:28350) | Varies | Transformed to WGS84 via Apache SIS |

### Examples in data

```turtle
@prefix geo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#> .

# EPSG:4326 — lat/lon order (explicit CRS prefix)
ex:site-a geo:asWKT "<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326> POINT(-33.87 151.21)"^^geo:wktLiteral .

# CRS84 — lon/lat order (bare WKT, no prefix, GeoSPARQL default)
ex:site-b geo:asWKT "POINT(151.21 -33.87)"^^geo:wktLiteral .

# Both index to the same location: Sydney, Australia
```

## Operators

| CQL2 operator | Lucene relation | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `s_intersects` | `INTERSECTS` | the indexed shape and the query geometry share any point |
| `s_within` | `WITHIN` | the indexed shape lies inside the query geometry |
| `s_contains` | `CONTAINS` | the indexed shape encloses the query geometry |
| `s_disjoint` | `DISJOINT` | the indexed shape and the query geometry share no point |

CQL2 argument order is `op(property, geometry)`, so `s_within` reads as *property within
geometry*. `s_equals`, `s_crosses`, `s_overlaps` and `s_touches` are parsed but have no
Lucene relation, so they raise rather than being silently dropped.

## Query geometries

Either the CQL2 `bbox` form or a GeoJSON object:

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| `bbox` | `{"bbox":[112,-44,154,-10]}` |
| `Point` | `{"type":"Point","coordinates":[116.35,-32.77]}` |
| `MultiPoint` | `{"type":"MultiPoint","coordinates":[[...],[...]]}` |
| `LineString` | `{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[...],[...]]}` |
| `MultiLineString` | `{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[...]],[[...]]]}` |
| `Polygon` | `{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[shell, hole1, ...]}` |
| `MultiPolygon` | `{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[shell],[shell]]}` |
| `GeometryCollection` | `{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[...]}` |

Several query geometries are **unioned**: a shape satisfying the relation against any one
of them matches. GeoJSON coordinate order is `[lon, lat]`.

### Zero-area query geometries do not match point data

A `Point` or `LineString` query geometry matches areal indexed shapes (polygons) but
**not** `POINT`-indexed entities. Lucene computes relations against indexed triangles, and
when neither side has area no intersection is reported. This holds for the dedicated
point-query API too, so it is a property of `LatLonShape` rather than a choice here.

The practical consequence: to find point-indexed entities at a location, use a small
`bbox` or `Polygon` rather than a `Point`. Point-in-polygon queries — the common case —
work exactly as expected. This is a silent empty result rather than an error, so it is
pinned by a test.

## Distance queries

`s_dwithin` matches entities within a radius of a point. It is an **extension**: CQL2 1.0's
spatial classes are purely topological and define no distance operator.

```json
{"op":"s_dwithin","args":[
  {"property":"urn:jena:lucene:field#location"},
  {"type":"Point","coordinates":[116.35,-32.77]},
  5000
]}
```

The third argument is the radius in **metres**, always. There is no units argument: Lucene's
circle takes metres, and a units parameter would be a second parser and a second class of
bug for no gain.

The geometry must be a GeoJSON `Point`; a radius around anything else is not expressible as
a single circle and raises. A third argument on a *topological* operator also raises rather
than being ignored, since accepting it would answer a different question than the one asked.

Unlike a `Point` used as a topological query geometry, a circle has area, so `s_dwithin`
matches point-indexed entities correctly.

## Relation semantics

These follow from DE-9IM, which both CQL2 (via OGC Simple Features clause 6.1.15) and
GeoSPARQL 1.1 (Table 2) require. Lucene agrees on all of them.

**A multi-valued field behaves as one geometry collection.** GeoSPARQL evaluates relations
through `geo:hasDefaultGeometry`, does not restrict its cardinality, and calls a feature
with several default geometries an application-specific modelling error producing
"logically inconsistent results" — so the intended model is one geometry per feature, with
multi-part features written as `MULTI*` or `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`. Under DE-9IM on a
collection, `within` holds only if the whole collection is inside and `disjoint` only if
every part is. That is exactly Lucene's per-document rule. An entity with a WA point and
an NSW point therefore *intersects* a WA box but is not *within* it and is not *disjoint*
from it.

**An entity with no geometry matches no relation, including `s_disjoint`.** GeoSPARQL's
query-rewrite rule must bind a geometry before the relation function runs, and CQL2 makes
a predicate with a NULL geometry evaluate to NULL. Lucene only visits documents that have
the field. All three agree, so an entity with no `geo:asWKT` is absent from every spatial
result — which is easy to get wrong for `s_disjoint`.

**Boundary contact is not "within".** DE-9IM `sfWithin` is `T*F**F***`, requiring a
non-empty interior-interior intersection, so a point lying exactly on the query polygon's
edge is not within it. Lucene agrees. Note also that coordinates are quantised to roughly
a centimetre on encoding, so exact boundary coincidence is not something to rely on
either way.

## Querying with CQL2-JSON spatial filters

Use a spatial operator in the CQL2-JSON filter argument of `luc:query`:

```sparql
PREFIX luc: <urn:jena:lucene:index#>

SELECT ?entity ?score WHERE {
    (?hit ?entity ?score) luc:query ("default" "*"
        '{"op":"s_intersects","args":[{"property":"urn:jena:lucene:field#location"},{"bbox":[112,-44,154,-10]}]}'
        20)
}
```

The `bbox` array follows the CQL2 convention: `[swLon, swLat, neLon, neLat]`.

A GeoJSON `Polygon` may also be given. Ring 0 is the exterior shell and rings 1..n are
interior rings (holes); holes are honoured, so a donut-shaped query polygon does not
match entities sitting inside the hole. GeoJSON coordinate order is `[lon, lat]`.

### Combining text search with spatial filter

```sparql
SELECT ?entity ?score WHERE {
    (?hit ?entity ?score) luc:query ("default" "gold mine"
        '{"op":"s_intersects","args":[{"property":"urn:jena:lucene:field#location"},{"bbox":[115,-35,120,-30]}]}'
        20)
}
```

This returns entities matching "gold mine" that are within the Western Australia bounding box.

### Combining with other CQL2 filters

Spatial filters can be combined with property filters using `and`:

```sparql
SELECT ?entity ?score WHERE {
    (?hit ?entity ?score) luc:query ("default" "*"
        '{"op":"and","args":[{"op":"=","args":[{"property":"urn:jena:lucene:field#state"},"WA"]},{"op":"s_intersects","args":[{"property":"urn:jena:lucene:field#location"},{"bbox":[115,-35,120,-30]}]}]}'
        20)
}
```

## Current limitations

- `s_equals`, `s_crosses`, `s_overlaps` and `s_touches` have no Lucene equivalent and raise.
- A zero-area query geometry does not match point-indexed data; see "Query geometries" below.

## Unsupported spatial filters raise

A spatial filter that cannot be pushed to Lucene raises `TextIndexException`; it is
never ignored. This covers an unsupported operator, an unsupported query geometry, a
property that names no field, and a property whose field is not a `LatLonField`.

The alternative would be to drop the filter, which is what earlier versions did. A
dropped spatial filter is not applied anywhere — nothing re-evaluates it in ARQ — so the
query silently returns **more** rows than were asked for. Inside an `or` it is worse: the
whole disjunction is abandoned, so every other branch is dropped too. Raising turns a
wrong answer into a refused one.

Note that query APIs take **field IRIs**, not bare field names. A bare name resolves to
no field and now raises rather than silently dropping the filter.
