[WARNING] The top project (/workspaces/jena/jena-text/pom.xml) cannot be found in the reactor from root project (/workspaces/jena/pom.xml). Make sure the root directory is correct (a missing '.mvn' directory in the root project is the most common cause) and the project is correctly included in the reactor (missing activated profiles, command line options, etc.). For this build, the top project will be used as the root project.
