 * Two things are worth knowing before reading on:

 * 1. The app discovers the index shape from GET /$/config/effective. It does NOT parse
 *    config.ttl. Field types, facetability, the hierarchy dimension name and the
 *    index-fingerprint status all come from the server, which is the only party that
 *    knows what Jena actually resolved.
 *
 * 2. Labels are never joined into the search query. Every IRI is resolved by its own
 *    cacheable GET through labels.js, so the browser's HTTP cache serves repeat views
 *    with no network at all. See labels.js for why that beats one batched VALUES query.
